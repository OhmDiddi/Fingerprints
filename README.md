This Python code takes an image of a ballot with some form of visible adulteration and preprocess it then identifies any adulteration via template matching. The dataset which was employed in this project was publicly available images of voting ballots from the 1988 Mexican presidential election. Initially, our goal was to do this same process with a new set of data; however, finding publicly available datasets were virtually impossible. Thus, we changed our research question to the creation of a more simple computational model which is outlined in the report.
